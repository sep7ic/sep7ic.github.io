I cant wait for the day everyone walks into my room and tells me my suspicions were correct and I am living in some sort of real life version of the episode "special service" from the 1989 twilight zone show.
God is testing me; or whoever is behind this all is definitely testing me. Throughout my life, theyve been introducing more and more absurd things, to see if I catch on. Are you meaning to tell me that the mexican alien was a real thing? Yeah, nah. 
But i've caught on. I caught on a year ago. But the last time I told someone what I was feeling, they didnt care. The second time, they threatened to send me to a mental hospital. I dont know how to escape this hell. I can't tell anyone. Perhaps I need to get up infront of a large crowd in town and shout it for everyone to hear. Then they'll have realised I caught on. They are probably aware I know. And they definitely will after I publish this post. 
The truman show was a clue to help me realise. I remember watching it as a young kid with my dad, and thinking nothing of it. But now I realise the real message.
