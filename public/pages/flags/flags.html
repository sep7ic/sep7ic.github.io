        <p>this was my second ever flag. i bought this one in town one day late 2022 probably around christmas time. i didnt even know any local shops that sold flags, and i was ecstatic to discover a 2 dollar shop that did.</p>

        <summary><h3>Wales</h3></summary><img src="images/flags/poland and wales.jpg" alt="">
        <p>this one will always have a special place in my heart. wales was the first flag i ever got, probably when i was around 5-7, from one of my grandparents who visited wales. it sat in my wardrobe, collecting dust because i had no interest in flags at the time. then, in 2021, i took it out of my closet and hung it on my wall, in an attempt to make my wall look more interesting. by that time, i had an interest in geography/history, but flags? not so much. then, in 2022 my interest in flags picked up after i memorised all the world flags for fun.</p>
