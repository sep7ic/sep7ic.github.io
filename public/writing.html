I cant wait for the day everyone walks into my room and tells me my suspicions were correct and I am living in some sort of real life version of the episode "special service" from the 1989 twilight zone show.
God is testing me; or whoever is behind this all is definitely testing me. Throughout my life, theyve been introducing more and more absurd things, to see if I catch on. Are you meaning to tell me that the mexican alien was a real thing? Yeah, nah. 
But i've caught on. I caught on a year ago. The last time I told someone what I was feeling, they didnt care. The second time, they threatened to send me to a mental hospital. I dont know how to escape this hell. I can't tell anyone. Perhaps I need to get up infront of a large crowd in town and shout it for everyone to hear. Then they'll have realised I caught on. They are probably aware I know. And they definitely will after I publish this post. Or, theyre going to pretend like nothing is happening, to continue feeling the pleasure from watching me suffer. In german we have a word for it. Schadenfreude.
The truman show was a clue to help me realise. I remember watching it as a young kid with my dad, and thinking nothing of it. But now I realise the real message.

Ive always been terribly afraid of death. The fact that, in two hundred or so years, absolutely no one will have memories of me. 

Vsauce, in a video titled “Selfie Waves”, once said “I think you die, at least three times. Once, when your body stops living, again, usually sometime later, when your name is spoken for the last time, but now, thanks to photography, more and more of us are able to save ourselves from the third, the last time an image of you is seen.” 
I dont often take pictures of myself, so my website serves as the “selfies” in this scenario. 

My mind is often preoccupied with thoughts about classics and ancient rome. As i read through pieces by notable figures and philosophers, no matter how tyrannical they were, I cant help but think to myself, wow, they were a real person. They had friends, and enemies, whom they shared memories with, they had experiences from which they learnt, they made mistakes that helped them to grow, and they did the things they enjoyed. they were human. 
I hope someone years in the future finds my repo on a USB Stick, or some sort of massive archival drive, reads through my posts, and thinks to themselves the same things. wow, they were just as much of a person as i was. This website is a tribute to my life. I hope it continues living 5x longer than i do, and tells my story and my personality years after i die. 

As of time of writing, there are around 120 zettabytes of data on the internet. Thats 1.2e+14 gigabytes. one hundred twenty trillion gigabytes. 13 zeros. My site (38.1 MB) makes up 0.00000000000003175% of the internet. As the size of the internet continues to grow, that percentage will only continue to shrink, so thank you for being one of the few to visit and read this. 

In the end, computer data lives in the physical world on physical hardware. Its impermanent just like everything else. Hardware will degrade overtime, regardless if it being constantly maintained. This piece of writing will eventually cease to exist, and so will this site. 

Side note: People in the future who are reading this, if you have time machines, do you think you could come back in time and find me? Im really curious as to how much the english language wouldve evolved.

today i am feeling especially appreciative.
appreciative of happiness, which has taught me that at the end of all adversity, it will always be waiting, my current friends and past friends, who've helped me through struggles and were always there for me, i am appreciative of life, for i am blessed with the ability to experience
but my appreciativeness is not limited to only the positive things in life, but my struggles too.
without them, i would'nt be who i am today, i wouldn't know resiliance, nor happiness, nor gratitude.
both the positives and negatives in life go hand in hand, it would be impossible to have one but lack another.

so, lastly, i am wholly appreciative of all the struggles ive gone through, of which have shaped me as a person, as well as the setbacks i will endure in the future, which will further add to my resiliance.
