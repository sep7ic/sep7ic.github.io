in the 17th and 19th centries, black slaves worked mainly on the tobacco and rice plantations of the southern coast - later cotton feilds
even though the usa government banned the african slave trade in 1808 (meaning no new slvaes arruced from africa, domestic trade flourished)
by 1860, there were nearly 4 million slaves in the usa
