      <p>hey there!! im iso or tide(pod)</p>
      <p>welcome to my site. massive work in progress. make sure you dont hit your head while browsing, good luck</p>
      <p>this is just my little space on the internet where i can express who i am and what i like without judgement. basically and archive for my thoughts because my thoughts are that important. i love space, flags, programming and isopods :) my favourite pass-time is scrolling on neocities </p>
      <p>i love flags more than i love isopods, so expect more of that. sorry if there was anyone who was actually excited about reading shit about isopods </p>
      <p>sorry for the ugly colours. im working on that too. dont be suprised if you come back and the site looks completely different, happened to my old one too which i abandoned 3 days before this sites creation xd</p>
