<h2>USS Enterprise - 1701</h2>
<span>18/02/24</span>
<p>it would be criminal to not begin this series of posts with the classic enterprise seen in <i>The Original Series</i>. heres some info about her!</p>
<p>she was first seen in the episode "the man trap"/TOS in 1966, under the command of James T Kirk. Her first captain was Robert April, who was promoted to Admiral and was succedded by his first officer, Christopher Pike, in 2250. Kirk gained command at stardate 1278.4 after pike was promoted to fleet captain.</p>
<p>Matt Jefferies was responsible for designing the ship, while roddenberry laid out what he did and did not want (roddenberry specifically asked for the vessel to have no resemblance to any current space ships [no smoke, no jet intakes, no rocket exhaust etc])</p>

<p>Jefferies then fleshed out his early concepts further, and finally settled on one to be used in the show.</p>

<p>The design was then carved into a wooden statue to be used for the filming of the show.</p>

<p>Jefferies also describes how the Enterprise's registry number came to be:</p>
<p>"I wanted a very simple number that could be spotted quickly. You’d have to eliminate 3, 6, 8 and 9, so I just went for 1701, which incidentally and coincidentally, happens to be very close to the license number on my airplane — NC-17740. But I have never really stepped out and squashed the rumor that the number on the Enterprise came off my airplane."</p>
