    {"ep": 1, "season": 1, "plot": 23, "writing": 24, "humour": 22, "personal": 23, "overall": 92, "quote": "Shinier than yours, meatbag.", "review": "This is a great episode. The plot is amazing, and its honestly such a good way to start off. You can clearly tell how much effort was put into the development of the plot, and david x cohen even mentions in the dvd commentary how they were overly ambitious and had TWO HOURS worth of content. I give the plot a solid 23/25. As for the writing, it was awesome too. Each character has their own distinct personality, and its differentiated really well. benders first line in the entire show is 'bite my shiny metal ass', and his second one 'shinier than yours, meatbag'. from this we get the idea that bender is, well, a cunt. hes more humorously sarcastic about everthing. first impression leela gives off a more serious but lighthearted (note to self: find better word) demeanor. she clearly cares about her job but its also evident that she just wants to let fry be. i mean, she even ends up taking out her career chip, because of the impression fry gave her. the writing gets a 24/25. the humour was really well played and i actually laughed quite a few times. for that, the humour section gets a 22. and last but not least, the person rating. i guess all these ratings are personal and based off my objective opinion but eh. i love this episode and it will always have a special place in my heart, no matter what anyone else says about it. 23/25."}
